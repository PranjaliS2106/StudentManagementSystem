Student Management System
Objective: Build a console-based Student Management System that demonstrates all the concepts
Core Requirements:
1. Class Hierarchy (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

Create an abstract Person class with common attributes (name, ID, age)
Extend it with Student and Teacher classes
Include abstract methods that subclasses must implement

2. Data Management (Data Structures, Arrays)

Use a LinkedList to store student records
Implement a Stack for maintaining operation history (undo functionality)
Use a Queue for managing pending admissions/requests
Include array-based grade storage for each student

3. Operations (Methods, Overloading, Overriding)

Add, delete, search, and update student records
Overload methods (e.g., search by ID, name, or both)
Override toString() and equals () methods appropriately

4. Searching & Sorting (Algorithms)

Implement linear search to find students by name
Implement binary search to find students by sorted ID
Sort student list by grades or names

5. Object-Oriented Principles

Encapsulation: Private fields with getters/setters
Static members: Track total number of students
Constructors: Parameterized and default constructors
Scanner: Interactive menu-driven console input

6. Advanced Features

Calculate and display student statistics (average grades, top performer)
Exception handling for invalid inputs
Display menu using control statements (switch-case, loops)




Sample Menu Output Structure:

1. Add new student
2. Remove student
3. Search student
4. Display all students
5. Sort students by grade
6. Show statistics
7. Undo last operation
8. Exit

Compile the program:

- Select "Run Java"

Expected Output

When you run the program, you should see:

=================================
Student Management System
=================================
1. Add new student
2. Add to pending admissions
3. Process pending admission

The Program Outline is given below kindly modify/edit it with proper code. 
Note: Only use Java Language
